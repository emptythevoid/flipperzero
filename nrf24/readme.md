Use this bin file to attempt to downgrade a compatible Logitech Unifying Receiver.  This is a dump of a known-vulnerable receiver running firmware 
RQR12.03_B0025. I have successfully flashed this to a receiver that was running a newer (patched) firmware.

Usage: 

If on Ubuntu, first do:

sudo apt install golang-go

Then:

git clone https://github.com/mame82/munifying

cd munifying

go build

sudo ./munifying flash -r /path/to/dump.bin

## Errors:
If munifying says "CAUTION: According to bootloader version, only signed firmwares are accepted! Closing Logitech Receiver in bootloader mode... Error provided firmware has no signature, but the bootloader requires one." This means that the firmware on the dongle has been updated to enforce signature checks, and cannot be downgraded to vulnerable firmware.

## Common and Identified Vulnerabilities:
M705

M325

M185

MK320 (keyboard/mouse combo)

G700 Gaming Mouse (non-unifying receiver)

Older R800 (not sure firmware/hardware revision. Has an LCD and green laser pointer button.)

## Notes:
9/18/24: New MK520 bundle (mouse M310) not vulnerable.   Dongle using signed firmware

9/18/24: New-in-box R400 not able to be sniffed

11/14/24: New-in-box Logitech M185 using dongle "046d:c542 Logitech, Inc. Wireless Receiver" was not detected by 2MBbps or 1 MBps scan. Solaar didn't even detect this as a logitech adapter.
